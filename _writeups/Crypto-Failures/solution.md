## Walkthrough {#start}

### Exploring the Application {#app}
It seems like TryHackMe is really into their crypto recently, well then let's jump in amici miei!

The first thing, as always, is to visit the IP address from our browser to gather a sense of what the application is like. Unlike the last cryptography challenge we went over, this time the website seems to be much more "bare-bones":

![index rendered](Crypto-Failures/images/index.png)

Don't let that fool you however, my detective instincts are already starting to itch. In particular, why is "crypt" in "encryption" <b>bold</b>? To investigate, I decided to take a look at the HTML to see if there was anything useful, and sure there was!
![index html](Crypto-Failures/images/indexHTML.png)
```html
<!-- TODO remember to remove .bak files -->
```
<i>Daje</i> that's what we like to see! Before enumerating with ffuf, I wanted to see if the .bak file mentioned was actually the index page in which we are located, and what do you know, it was exactly that!

If you visit ```http://[MACHINE_IP]/index.php.bak``` we get a very interesting file. Probably however the challenge wanted us to find this by enumeration, so I will leave the ffuf command if you wanna do it the "right" way.
```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-CDecrypting Encrypted Secret - Second Flag
<?php
include('config.php');

function generate_cookie($user,$ENC_SECRET_KEY) {
    $SALT=generatesalt(2);
    
    $secure_cookie_string = $user.":".$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'].":".$ENC_SECRET_KEY;

    $secure_cookie = make_secure_cookie($secure_cookie_string,$SALT);

    setcookie("secure_cookie",$secure_cookie,time()+3600,'/','',false); 
    setcookie("user","$user",time()+3600,'/','',false);
}

function cryptstring($what,$SALT){

return crypt($what,$SALT);

}


function make_secure_cookie($text,$SALT) {

$secure_cookie='';

foreach ( str_split($text,8) as $el ) {
    $secure_cookie .= cryptstring($el,$SALT);
}

return($secure_cookie);
}


function generatesalt($n) {
$randomString='';
$characters = '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';
for ($i = 0; $i < $n; $i++) {
    $index = rand(0, strlen($characters) - 1);
    $randomString .= $characters[$index];
}
return $randomString;
}



function verify_cookie($ENC_SECRET_KEY){


    $crypted_cookie=$_COOKIE['secure_cookie'];
    $user=$_COOKIE['user'];
    $string=$user.":".$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'].":".$ENC_SECRET_KEY;

    $salt=substr($_COOKIE['secure_cookie'],0,2);

    if(make_secure_cookie($string,$salt)===$crypted_cookie) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}


if ( isset($_COOKIE['secure_cookie']) && isset($_COOKIE['user']))  {

    $user=$_COOKIE['user'];

    if (verify_cookie($ENC_SECRET_KEY)) {
        
    if ($user === "admin") {
   
        echo 'congrats: ******flag here******. Now I want the key.';

            } else {
        
        $length=strlen($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']);
        print "<p>You are logged in as " . $user . ":" . str_repeat("*", $length) . "\n";
	    print "<p>SSO cookie is protected with traditional military grade en<b>crypt</b>ion\n";    
    }

} else { 

    print "<p>You are not logged in\n";
   

}

}
  else {

    generate_cookie('guest',$ENC_SECRET_KEY);
    
    header('Location: /');


}
?>
```
This seems pretty scary at first, so let's break down the sections that we care about.

It seems like this website is using a special cookie (namely ```secure_cookie```) to ensure authentication in the website. This cookie is made taking the ```user``` cookie, the HTTP header `USER_AGENT` and an encrypted secret key. 

All of this is encrypted in the `cryptstring()` function using the `crypt()` php method (that's why crypt was bolded in the HTML file!). By default this method uses standard DES, which is a pretty old and vulnerable encryption algorithm. 

In particular, and this is the key to the challenge, DES <b>only</b> encrypts the first 8 characters of a string, hence why in the `make_secure_cookie` function the text is encrypted in 8 characters chunk from the following for loop:
```php
foreach ( str_split($text,8) as $el ) {
    $secure_cookie .= cryptstring($el,$SALT);
}
```
Another very insecure thing about this file is how the salt is generated. This is the result of just 2 characters picked randomly from a set of numbers and letters. The salt can also be seen at the beginning of our cookie, as we can easily discover by the following line in `verify_cookie()`:
```php
$salt=substr($_COOKIE['secure_cookie'],0,2);
```
Knowing all of this information, we can now start break some things!

### Forging Admin Cookie - First Flag {#first}
As I said before, the key to this challenge is the fact that DES breaks our ciphertext into chunks of the same length. This pattern can be easily spotted thanks to the salt, take this cookie for example: 
```
YVxrXiItMvl4.YVXAfPSj79DCsYVMOFnVbr4PoIYVp7zS9yqUwPsYVwm7yUPcW6XMYV6jUWQdWxwqsYVn%2Fwry9OoIKsYVS1TOZVTMVIQYV5KB0kA8z2cMYVmBxRMGfPAtEYVfhV8vlgf3qMYVLWgc8OnNTBAYVOtDQQLlcYi.YVaXxTxsR8rg2YVuwQ11nXRn0.YVtHlTRlWDnJkYVdJ2TKN0h.ikYVRfA9fh205ZUYVmDZo%2Fdju%2FT2YV5maG%2FQ8tA0gYV9Mi9FghWBlQ
```
Do you see the pattern here? How about now?
> <u><b>YV</u></b>xrXiItMvl4.<b><u>YV</b></u>XAfPSj79DCs<b><u>YV</b></u>MOFnVbr4PoI<b><u>YV</b></u>p7zS9yqUwPs<b><u>YV</b></u>wm7yUPcW6XM etc...

These 13 character blocks are equivalent to the 8 characters we saw in the for loop a while back. Amici mie, grab your hammers because it is time to forge!

The first thing is to grab a valid guest cookie, I will use Burp Suite for the rest of the challenge, so make sure you know how to use it or use an equivalent tool of your choice. If you are unfamiliar with burp and you wanna follow along, check out this TryHackMe room: [Burp Tutorial](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuitebasics). 

Before grabbing the cookie however, we need to do some manipulation to make our life easier. Even before visiting the site, activate the Burp Proxy and change the `USER_AGENT` header to
```
User-Agent: AAAAAAAA
```
The actual content doesn't matter, the important thing is that it is 8 characters long (i.e. a block in DES). After you do this, send the request and observe the cookie you got back. Thanks to the backup file, we know that our decrypted cookie will look something like this:
```
guest:AAAAAAAA:[Encrypted Secret Key]
```
Which means that the first 13 characters of our encrypted cookie will translate to the first 8 characters of that string, `guest:AA`. To forge an admin cookie, all we need to do is replace this initial block with `admin:AA`, we can do this by encrypting it using the following php script:
```php
<?php

function cryptstring($what,$SALT){

    return crypt($what,$SALT);
    
}

echo cryptstring("admin:AA", $SALT)

?>
```
where `$SALT` is the first two characters of your original cookie. If you are lost, take this example cookie:
```
YVxrXiItMvl4.YVXAfPSj79DCsYVMOFnVbr4PoIYVp7zS9yqUwPsYVwm7yUPcW6XMYV6jUWQdWxwqsYVn%2Fwry9OoIKsYVS1TOZVTMVIQYV5KB0kA8z2cMYVmBxRMGfPAtEYVfhV8vlgf3qMYVLWgc8OnNTBAYVOtDQQLlcYi.YVaXxTxsR8rg2YVuwQ11nXRn0.YVtHlTRlWDnJkYVdJ2TKN0h.ikYVRfA9fh205ZUYVmDZo%2Fdju%2FT2YV5maG%2FQ8tA0gYV9Mi9FghWBlQ
```
The first block is
```
YVxrXiItMvl4.
```
which we know is "guest:AA", to make it "admin:AA" all we need to do is replace that block with the output of this code:
```php
<?php

function cryptstring($what,$SALT){

    return crypt($what,$SALT);
    
}

echo cryptstring("admin:AA", "YV")

?>
```
which is:
```
YV82.Eux48iAQ
```
so our final cookie will be
> <u><b>YV82.Eux48iAQ</b></u>YVXAfPSj79DCsYVMOFnVbr4PoIYVp7zS9yqUwPsYVwm7yUPcW6XMYV6jUWQdWxwqsYVn%2Fwry9OoIKsYVS1TOZVTMVIQY<br>V5KB0kA8z2cMYVmBxRMGfPAtEYVfhV8vlgf3qMYVLWgc8OnNTBAYVOtDQQLlcYi.YVaXxTxsR8rg2YVuwQ11nXRn0.YVtHlTRlWDnJkYVd<br>J2TKN0h.ikYVRfA9fh205ZUYVmDZo%2Fdju%2FT2YV5maG%2FQ8tA0gYV9Mi9FghWBlQ

Now all we need to do is send this cookie (remember to also change the `user` cookie to "admin" and to keep the `User-Agent` header as "AAAAAAAA") and we will be logged in as admin, getting our first flag!

### Decrypting Encrypted Secret - Second Flag {#second}
Now that we know the main vulnerability of the app, we can use it to decrypt the secret Key too!

To do this, we will abuse three things:
- The fact that DES uncrypts every 8 characters
- Known padding from the flag (all TryHackMe flags start with THM{ and end with })
- The ability to manipulate the lenght of blocks thanks to the `User-Agent` HTTP header.

First, we know that the first block is always going to be guest (or admin) followed by a colon and the first two characters of the `User-Agent` header, for example
```text
guest:AA
```
The second block is where things start to get interesting. You see, cracking 8 characters from DES will require my poor RTX 3050 laptop to run for about 11 years <b>per block</b>. Considering that this is a <b>very</b> long flag (you can see this under the challenge question), brute-forcing is not feasible, unless... we don't have to crack the full 8 blocks! As mentioned earlier, we know some of the padding of the flag, so we can use that to our advantage.

Using our 8 As `User-Agent` cookie, we know that the second block must be:
```text
AAAAAA:T
```
A quick verification with the php code provided will prove this too!

So now instead of having to crak 8 characters, we just need to crack 6, because we know that the next block has to start with:
```text
HM{
```
we can crack the next characters with the following hashcat command:
```bash
hashcat -m 1500 -a 3 hash.txt "HM{?1?1?1?1?1" -1 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789?s 
```
If you are a bit rusty with hashcat, here is a quick explanation of what is going on:
- The -m flag tells hashcat what algorithm we are cracking, in our case it is DES (which is code 1500)
- The -a flag tells hashcat that we are trying to bruteforce the hash
- hash.txt contains the third block of the cookie (assuming it has an 8 character `User-Agent`)
- `"HM{?1?1?1?1?1"` is the mask, we need to pass this so that hashcat can use the known padding to speed up the process drammatically
- Lastly, the -1 flag represents our charset, which is all ASCII characters

Running this commad will reveal the first bit of the flag... if you don't have a potato pc. You see, 5 characters in DES is not a lot if you have a dedicated gpu, but if that is not you don't worry! Keep reading and you will see you to reduce the cracking time even more.

But after cracking the third block we are kind of stuck, the fourth block is still a bit too long to crack... What if we make the cookie a bit more revealing?

 To achieve this, we can just make the `User-Agent` a bit shorter, say 4 As instead of 8. This means that we will have this situation:
```text
First block: guest:AA
Second block: AA:THM{*
Third block: ****----
```
Due to TryHackMe policy I cannot show the flag, but in the section above `*` stands for characters we cracked with the previous cookie and `-` for characters we are trying to crack, meaning our hashcat command will be:
```bash
hashcat -m 1500 -a 3 hash.txt "****?1?1?1?1" -1 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789?s 
```
By doing this, we now have the first characters of the next block in previous cookie (the one with the 8 character `User-Agent`). You see where this is going? By alternating cracking between the two cookies, one with 8 character of `User-Agent` and the other with 4, we can cut in half the characters we need to crack!

Now all we have to do is rinse and repeat this process until we have the full flag. Personally, I did this process by hand, but I am sure there afre tools or scripts out there that can automate this process. If you know such thing feel free to open an issue, and I will review it as fast as possible.

After a bit of hashcat, we finally have our second flag!

## Main Takeaways {#end}
As always, there is a lot to learn in these challenges. Today we have two main Takeaways:
1. Don't use DES in 2025. This algorithm is half a century old and not secure. Even if we didn't exploit those padding vulnerabilities, cracking a block is shockingly fast with the right hardware
2. Follow industry standards for your cookies. You saw what happens when you use your own formula for these delicious tokens, but unlike my nonna's recipe you should not add a secret ingredient, especially if the user can modify it.

And that's it for Crypto-Failures! Ci vediamo alla prossima amici!
