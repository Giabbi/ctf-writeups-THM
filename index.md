## Structure of Writeups
Each writeup follows this structure (and more):

1. **Introduction**: A brief description of the challenge and its objectives.
2. **Steps to Solve**:
   - Step-by-step walkthrough of the challenge.
   - Screenshots and payloads where applicable.
3. **Key Learnings**: What I learned or improved upon during the challenge.
4. **Conclusion**: Final thoughts on the challenge, and the aforementioned Italian stuff (evviva!)

## Tools and Technologies
Here are some tools and technologies I frequently use while solving challenges:
- **Python**: For scripting custom servers and payloads.
- **Burp Suite**: For intercepting and manipulating HTTP traffic.
- **Wireshark**: For network analysis.
- **Nmap**: For network reconnaissance.
- **Custom Scripts**: Tailored for specific challenge requirements.
Remember! You are not a script kiddie if you know what's going on (I hope).
